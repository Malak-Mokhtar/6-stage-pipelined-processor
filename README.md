a 6-stage (memory stage split into two stages) pipelined processor with
Harvard architecture.The processor has a RISC-like instruction set architecture. There are 25 instructions, an
interrupt signal and a Rst signal implemented. Data hazards, structural hazards and control hazards are
handled. Assembler code is provided that converts assembly program (Text File) into machine code
according to the design (Memory File)
